# Brew-Tea-Full Ways Of Working

## Personal Responsibilities

1. Every team member is responsible for ensuring that we collectively adhere to our ways of working agreement. <br />

2. Every team member is responsible for demonstrating proactivity wherever possible. <br />

3. Every team member is responsible for the work that we as a collective produce. <br />

4. In light of this, every team member is therefore responsible for raising concerns, issues and suggestions as they arise. <br />

5. Every team member is responsible for everyone feeling heard, repected and valued. Negative communication or unecessary criticism is not acceptable. <br />

6. Every team member is responsible for ensuring that we do what we have agreed to and that we stick to that. <br />

7. Every team member is responsible for ensuring that unassigned tickets are raised. This can be done via Slack, during daily Stand-ups or during daily Wind-down meetings. <br />



## Typical daily structure

### Daily Stand-Up
Team-work starts with a daliy stand-up that will last for up to 10 minutes. During this stand-up; <br />

• The meeting starts after each team member must contributes one positive thing - no excuses, no exceptions! <br />
• The scrum master will then set a 10 minute timer. <br />
• We will discuss and proactively assign oursleves to **all** tickets. <br />
• We will make neccassry and appropiate group decisions via a vote. <br />
• Where this is inefficient for any reaosn, a final decision will be made by the scrum master. <br />

### Wind-down Meeting
The team will reconvene for 15 minutes at the end of each day to; <br />

• Discuss progress with tickets. <br />
• Demo code that is ready for to be merged into the main branch. <br />
• If everyone is happy, merge and pull requests can be completed. <br />
• Where this is not the case, new tickets are created to keep track of constructive feedback and whether this has been actioned. <br />

## Communication
We will be using; <br />

• Zoom <br />
• Slack <br />
• GitHub (commit messages) and <br />
• Trello to track and manage tasks. <br />

## Rules for Communication on Zoom
To create a healthy and respectful environment, we as a team have agreed to stick to rules when communicating with each other. <br />

These rules are; <br />
• Using the hand-up emoji to create a queuing system for speaking. <br />
• If someone has raised their hand and is speaking, everybody waits until that person is finished before sharing their thoughts. Interruptions are a no-no! <br />
• We will vote when making group decisions, using ticks or crosses to indicate our choice. Majority rules, decisions are final and persistent. <br />
• Once a team consensus has been met, we will not assume that this has changed at any given point unless we, **as a team**, decide to change it. <br />

## Standard Practice for using GitHub

### Branches
Every branch must refer to a ticket. The naming convention we have agreed will be; <br />

"ticket reference" / "a descriptive title"

For example: <br />
"S1.2/generate_sql_tables" <br />

### Pull-requests
Pull requests can only be made if code meets the base criteria below, in addition to the acceptance criteria specified on the ticket.

### Base Acceptance Criteria
• Files must have descriptive names. <br />
• Files must be saved in appropiate folders. <br />
• Functions must have desciptive names. <br />
• Functions must use type hinting. <br />
• Must follow PEP8 coding guidelines. <br />
• Must include unit test/s. <br />
• Must demonstrate that code passes said unit tests. <br />
• Must include descriptive error messages and print statements for logging purposes. <br />

### Commit messages
Acceptable commit messages are added frequently and are written in the present tense. Non-verbose messages, vaugue and infrequently added commit messages will be called out. <br />

### Merging to Main branch
Merging a branch to main must be completed by a team that **did not develop the code**. <br />

The code must be confirmed to be "Done" (see our definition below).

## Standard Practice for Trello Tickets

Acceptable Trello tickets must:

### 1. Be centred around the user
Whether that be us (the engineers) or the customer.

The format must be structured like this: <br />
**As a**...  **I want**...  **So that**... <br />

**For example**, "As a business owner, I want to see reports of sales on graphs so that I can identify patterns and trends and make informed business decisions to maximise sales".

### 2. Must include thorough acceptance criteria
In addition to our base acceptance criteria, tickets must be categorically distinct in the steps that will be taken to complete the task at hand. <br />

Tickets for functions must include: <br />
• What it will accept as arguments, and <br />
• What the expected output will be. <br />

### 3. Have a member/s of the team assigned to it.
This must be agreed in a **group setting** and fairly distrubuted (using the scale labels as a guide). <br />

**Assigning yourself to a ticket without anybody knowing is a no-no!** <br />

**Doing somebody elses ticket is also a no-no!** <br />

The aim is productive collaboration. <br />

### 4. Must be lablled appropiately to identify the scale of the task (i.e. Small, Medium and Large)

### 5. Must be lablled according the sprint it belongs to, with each ticket having a uniquely identifiable number. 

For example, on a board named 'Sprint 1', a ticket may be named 'S1.1' and so on. <br />

## Our group definition of done
• Base acceptance requirements is met <br />
• Specific acceptance criteria on each ticket is met <br />
• The features are useable <br />
• The features must successfully pass unit tests <br />

After these requirements have been met, the ticket can be moved into 'Done'.
Every group member must be able to comfortably demonstrate this to the team in the daily wind-down meetings.
